In this query:

We first create a common table expression (CTE) called UserPhotoCounts to calculate the number of photos each user has posted and 
to assign an order to the photos based on their creation date for each user.

Within the CTE, we select the username, user_id, and created_at, and use the ROW_NUMBER() window function to determine the order of the photos based on their creation date.
We also use the COUNT(*) window function to calculate the total number of photos each user has posted.

In the main query, we select the username from the user's table and retrieve the total_photos (number of photos posted by the user), 
the photos_before (number of photos posted by the user before), 
and the photos_after (number of photos posted by the user after) using the LAG() and LEAD() window functions, respectively.
These functions look at the order determined in the CTE.

We join the users table with the UserPhotoCounts CTE based on the user_id.

Finally, we order the results by the created_at date to show the information in chronological order based on the creation date of the photos.

This query will give you the username of each user, the number of photos they have posted, 
and the number of photos posted by the user before and after them based on the creation date of the photos.
